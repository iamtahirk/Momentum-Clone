# Personal Dashboard (Momentum Clone)
## Scrimba code along project

I have added a few further options to the dashboard to make it more like Momentum.

Includes:

- Current bitcoin, ethereum and tether price.
- Live weather (will require access to your location)
- Today's Focus
- One click 12/24 Hour Time Format with corresponding greetings message
- Live background using Unsplash API with a link to particular image @unsplash.
- Random Quote Display
- Todos with local storage.

It uses local storage for name, todos, and today's focus.

Here is how to set this up as chrome extension:

1. Type **chrome://extensions/** in chrome addressbar and press enter.
2. Make sure developer mode (top right) is cheked and click load unpacked.![Custom Chrome extension setup](./images/extension.png)
3. Locate and select the folder which includes the code.

This was an awesome project taught by [Bob Ziroll](https://github.com/bobziroll) from scrimba's [Front-end Developer Career Path](https://scrimba.com/learn/frontend).
